Here’s a reliable set of PostgreSQL queries you can run directly against the Black Duck database to **prove objectively** whether the vulnerability is truly present in the data (and therefore confirm it’s purely a UI/rendering/intermittent issue).

These queries ignore all UI filters, caching, pagination, etc. — they look only at what is actually stored.

### 1. First, confirm the component is correctly in the BOM (should return 1 row)
```sql
SELECT 
    p.project_name,
    pv.version_name,
    c.component_name,
    cv.version_name AS comp_version,
    pvc.in_bom,
    rs.review_status_name,
    pvc.match_type
FROM bdba.project p
JOIN bdba.project_version pv ON pv.project_id = p.project_id
JOIN bdba.project_version_component pvc ON pvc.project_version_id = pv.project_version_id
JOIN bdba.component_version cv ON cv.component_version_id = pvc.component_version_id
JOIN bdba.component c ON c.component_id = cv.component_id
LEFT JOIN bdba.review_status rs ON rs.review_status_id = pvc.review_status_id
WHERE p.project_name = 'Your-Project-Name'
  AND pv.version_name = 'Your-Version-Name'
  AND c.component_name = 'exact-component-name'
  AND cv.version_name = 'exact-component-version';
```

→ You should see `in_bom = true` and `review_status_name` probably “Not Reviewed” or blank.

### 2. Confirm that this exact component-version actually has vulnerabilities in the KB
```sql
SELECT 
    vuln.vulnerability_id AS cve_or_bdsa,
    vuln.vulnerability_name,
    vs.severity,
    vuln.source AS vuln_source  -- NVD or BDSA
FROM bdba.component_version cv
JOIN bdba.component c ON c.component_id = cv.component_id
JOIN bdba.component_version_vulnerability cvv ON cvv.component_version_id = cv.component_version_id
JOIN bdba.vulnerability vuln ON vuln.vulnerability_id = cvv.vulnerability_id
JOIN bdba.vulnerability_score vs ON vs.vulnerability_id = vuln.vulnerability_id
WHERE c.component_name = 'exact-component-name'
  AND cv.version_name = 'exact-component-version'
ORDER BY vs.severity DESC;
```

→ If this returns rows (especially BDSA-xxx ones), the data is definitely there.

### 3. Prove that Black Duck has linked those vulnerabilities to this specific project-version BOM entry
This is the most important one — if this returns rows, the backend knows about the vulnerabilities 100%. Any absence in the UI is purely client-side/intermittent.

```sql
SELECT 
    vuln.vulnerability_id AS cve_or_bdsa,
    vuln.vulnerability_name,
    vs.severity,
    vuln.source,
    pv.version_name AS project_version,
    p.project_name
FROM bdba.project p
JOIN bdba.project_version pv ON pv.project_id = p.project_id
JOIN bdba.project_version_component pvc ON pvc.project_version_id = pv.project_version_id
JOIN bdba.component_version cv ON cv.component_version_id = pvc.component_version_id
JOIN bdba.component c ON c.component_id = cv.component_id
JOIN bdba.component_version_vulnerability cvv ON cvv.component_version_id = cv.component_version_id
JOIN bdba.vulnerability vuln ON vuln.vulnerability_id = cvv.vulnerability_id
JOIN bdba.vulnerability_score vs ON vs.vulnerability_id = vuln.vulnerability_id
WHERE p.project_name = 'Your-Project-Name'
  AND pv.version_name = 'Your-Version-Name'
  AND c.component_name = 'exact-component-name'
  AND cv.version_name = 'exact-component-version'
  AND pvc.in_bom = true
ORDER BY vs.severity DESC;
```

If query #3 returns the exact same vulnerability rows you see on the component’s own Vulnerabilities sub-tab, but they still sometimes disappear from the main Security → Vulnerabilities grid → it is 100% confirmed as an intermittent UI/rendering issue (the same family of bugs that plagued 2023–2024 releases and that still very rarely resurfaces under high load or specific filter combinations in 2025.x).

You can hand the results of query #3 to Synopsys support with the note “Data is correctly linked server-side (see query), but intermittently missing from /ui/vulnerabilities grid” and they will immediately recognize it and either give you the current internal ticket or confirm it’s fixed in the next patch.

Replace the project/component/version placeholders with your real values (or add ILIKE/wildcards if you want to search broader). Let me know what these return and I can help interpret or tighten them further.
